# LED-Torch
This project is my first step into PCB designing, where I designed and implemented a simple LED Torch circuit using KiCad. Through this project, I explored the complete PCB design workflow starting from schematic capture to board layout and final manufacturing files.
Key Learnings:

Basics of KiCad software and its workflow

Working with Eeschema (schematic editor) and Pcbnew (layout editor)

Understanding electronic design concepts: schematic, symbols, footprints, pads, traces, silkscreen

Generating Gerber files and drill files for fabrication

Outcome:
A compact PCB layout for an LED Torch that can be directly manufactured.
